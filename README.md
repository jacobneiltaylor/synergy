Synergy
=======

Introduction
------------

Synergy is a modern, object-oriented, platform-independant dynamic loading library for C++, specifically designed for building extendable applications. It is designed to abstract away platform specific dynamic loading API's and provide a consistant and typesafe interface.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

* Windows (VS2015CRT, tested on Windows Server 2012)
* Linux (GNU G++, tested on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04)

We plan to support Mac OS X and BSD in future.
